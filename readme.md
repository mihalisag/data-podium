# 🏎️ Data Podium (in progress)

The Data Podium Application is a powerful data-driven tool designed to analyze Formula 1 race data. Built using Python, NiceGUI, and a Large Language Model (LLM), this application enables users to explore F1 data effortlessly, compare drivers, teams, and events, and uncover exciting insights.

## 🚀 Features

- **Driver-Level Analysis**: Compare drivers based on speed, lap times, positions, and other metrics.
- **Team-Level Analysis**: Evaluate team performance and pit stop strategies.
- **Session Analysis**: Dive into qualifying, race, or practice session statistics.
- **Event Analysis**: Explore rankings, overtakes, fastest laps, and other race-specific details.
- **Season Comparisons**: Compare multiple drivers, teams, or events across the season.
- **Generalized Function Support**: Add new queries easily by extending modular function definitions.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Streamlit**: For creating the interactive web application.
- **Python**: Core programming language for data analysis and function calling.
- **Large Language Model (LLM)**: For natural language understanding and generating responses.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and processing.
- **Matplotlib/Plotly**: Visualization of graphs and statistics.

## 🔍 How It Works

1. **Natural Language Input**: Users type questions about F1 races (e.g., "Who won the Monaco Grand Prix?").
2. **LLM Integration**: The model parses the query and maps it to a relevant function (e.g., `get_event_winner`).
3. **Function Calling**: The appropriate function retrieves data and processes the result.
4. **Output Visualization**: Results are displayed as text, graphs, or tables in an interactive interface.
